# ONLINE-FOOD-CAFE-s-ORDERING-SYSTEM

This program is written in C++ programming language.
The purpose of creating the system is to improve the customer service by providing a convenience to customers to make order through online and increase sales. Besides, it can save transport cost, calling charge and time. 
 This project consists of many subsystems and each of them had its own features and functions. The subsystem includes online ordering, receipt, delivery, SMS integration (via contact no).
Specification:
	Each time the program runs it takes a single customer’s order.

	At first, the customer gets a welcoming message about the Cafe’s ordering system.

	Customer must input his/her nick name, telephone number (to confirm the order), address (without space) to deliver the ordered foods.

	After that, our cafe menu will be shown to the customer to order various types of foods and drinks (Hot drinks, Cold drinks, Baguettes, Burgers and Snacks).Here the customer can select our items as he wants to order. Also He can add the quantity of desired items as much as he needs.

	The customer can order same items more than once if he wishes to do so.


	After ordering each item customer can choose either to continue or to go to the main menu to exit and get receipt.

	This program will be continued till the customer’s choice will be 0. After entering 0 in the main menu the program will exit and show the information, quantity and price of customer’s order. The price will be presented in RM.

	After the total price is counted, it adds GST(6%) for food tax. Including the tax the total price will be counted as final amount.

	This program will show the customer delivery information and via SMS we will confirm the order so that our servicer can deliver customer’s order perfectly.

	At the end we will print a “nice” message for our customer. 

	After completing the order our customer will get a receipt from our 24/7 cafe which will show cafe address, receipt number, current date, current time, user name, contact number, address, quantity of order and price(with and without GST).
